## Usage

You can start a day with the `deno task day <number>` command. Add the `--test` option to run the test input`. Otherwise, you can run the test cases or the
individual day files directly in your IDE. For VS-Code, sensible defaults are provided.

### With real input:

```bash
# without watcher
deno task day 1
# with watching
deno task dev 1
```

### With test input:

```bash
# without watcher
deno task day 1 -t
# with watcher
deno task dev 1 -t
# this runs all tests. Use Deno extension in VSCode to run individual tests.
deno test --allow-read
```

### Linting

```bash
deno lint
deno fmt
```

### Generating new day

using `deno task create-day <day>` you can automatically generate a new day:

```bash
deno task create-day 2
```

> Hint: to preview this, you can add the -d (dry run) option

## Folder structure

### `src/`

This folder contains the source code for the solutions. Each day has its own folder, with a two digit number name. All Common code is in the `utils/` folder.
Uses the files from the `data/` folder as input.

### `test/`

This folder contains the tests for the solutions. Each day has its own folder, with a two digit number name. Uses the files from the `data_test/` folder as
input.

### `data/`

This folder contains the input data for the solutions. The format is `day<day>.txt`. If a day has more than one input, the format`day<day>_<part>.txt` is used
for all parts except the first. Selecting the correct input is handled in the abstract `AdventOfCodeDay` class.

### `data_test/`

Same as `data/`, but for the test inputs.
